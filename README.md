### Description

I recreated my portfolio from the first homework assignment, but this time I used [Twitter-Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).  This allowed me to make a mobile responsive website using premade, modular CSS.  This required an understanding of CSS, but less mastery.  Although, I did use some custom CSS in situations which required it.  If I aim to become a front-end developer, then I would want to study Bootstrap and learn how all of it works, so I may modify it where I need to.  If I want to be a back-end developer, then a basic understanding of Bootsrap is satisfactory.
